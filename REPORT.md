## The Calligrapher

**Sultan Muhammad Khandan** (سلطان محمد خندان) was one of the foremost nastaʿlīq scribes of the Timurid–early Safavid transition. His laqab **خندان** ("smiling/cheerful") appears in his colophons either alone or as part of the fuller name. He was a student of **Sultan ʿAlī Mashhadī** (d. 926/1519–20), the pre-eminent nastaʿlīq master of the Herat school, and worked within the patronage circle of **Mīr ʿAlī Shīr Navāʾī**. The earliest dated work so far traced is a *Yūsuf va Zulaykha* from 915 AH / 1509–10 CE (private collection, Tehran); the latest is a *Subḥat al-Abrār* dated 972 AH / 1564 CE, now in the Gulbenkian Foundation (Lisbon).

**Activity range:** 915–972+ AH / 1509–1564+ CE (Bayani extends the outer limit to 992 AH / 1584 CE, but no dated copy beyond 972 AH has been traced in this project).
**Script:** nastaʿlīq (occasionally taʿlīq).
**Geography:** Herat; some works associated with Bukhara or Tabriz.
**Confusion risk:** Sultan Muhammad Nūr (سلطان محمد نور) — a distinct contemporary scribe active in the same milieu. The two scribes appear together in BL Or 11839 and Freer F1944.48.

## Search Methods

### YEK Portal (portal.yek.gov.tr = yazmalar.gov.tr)

Four search sessions (2026-02-25 to 2026-02-26) covering:

| Session | Strategy | Records examined | Khandan attributions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Term tiers 1–3+5: سلطان محمد خندان, محمد خندان, خندان هروی, colophon kernels, Latin variants in Nüshayla ilgili kişiler + İstinsah kaydı + Mühürler | — | 2 genuine |
| 2 | Expansion: tiers 2–4, title-based (Divan-i Bayqara, Ilahinama) | 19 candidate detail pages | 0 new |
| 3 | Protocol B: خندان alone, Genel notlar variants, Khondan Latin | — | 0 new |
| 4 | Title searches (Subhat, Layla, Yusuf, Bustan) with Nesta script filter | 52 | 0 new; 1 candidate (705856) |

**Conclusion:** YEK contains exactly 2 manuscripts attributed to Khandan in its cataloguing metadata. Topkapi Palace Library records are in YEK but without digitized images; no Topkapi Khandan attributions appear in any field.

### FIHRIST (fihrist.org.uk)

Searched 2026-02-26. Person record: <https://www.fihrist.org.uk/catalog/person_f4139>. Found 6 UK manuscripts.

### Museum and Auction Catalog Lookups

Conducted 2026-02-26 via web search and direct URL retrieval: Harvard Art Museums, Smithsonian/Freer, Cleveland Museum of Art, Gulbenkian Foundation, Sotheby's, Christie's, Bonhams.

### Online Catalog Sweep (2026-02-26)

Systematic scraping of online catalogs and web searches using Firecrawl CLI:

| Source | Result |
| --- | --- |
| FIHRIST person_f4139 | No new items (5 manuscripts, all already in corpus) |
| baysunghur.org (Saadati 2021) | ~29 items cross-referenced; 6 new codices, 7 new qitʿa/muraqqa entries, multiple raqm transcriptions |
| Chester Beatty Library catalog Vol. II (1960) | 2 new items: CBL Per 183 (Bustan, 916 AH) and CBL Per 184 (Hafiz, 920 AH) |
| Bonhams lot 27 | Enriched: £45,600, full provenance (Shah Abbas I → Shah Jahan → Shah Alam II) |
| Gulbenkian online catalog | RESOLVED: shelfmark LA159 confirmed; painter Abdullah al-Shirazi; origin Mashhad |
| Freer Gallery F1937.22 / F1944.48 | Enriched: title corrected ("Fettered Camel and Keeper"); gilder = Baba al-Mudhahhib |
| Web searches (English + Persian) | Chester Beatty PDF, Lyon & Turnbull reference, Wikimedia Commons files |

Corpus grew from 30 to **43 entries** (confirmed: 1, attributed: 12, catalogued: 26, unverified: 4). A further enrichment sweep on 2026-02-27 added 1 new entry (Christie's/Mayfair Bustan with "pasted, purported" Khandan signature) and resolved bl_hafiz_921 as a bibliographic error, bringing the corpus to **44 entries** (confirmed: 1, attributed: 12, catalogued: 26, unverified: 4, bibliographic_error: 1).

**Notes on the attributed group:**

- The Sotheby's 2018 *Laylī va Majnūn* (125 ff., gold nastaʿlīq, colophon in cloud formations) is one of the most fully described Khandan manuscripts on the market.
- The Christie's *Subḥat al-Abrār* (224 ff., Herat 930 AH) specifies place of copying. Christie's cites Karatay 1961 nos. 777 and 787 as Topkapi comparanda.
- Freer F1944.48 is collaborative: Rumi by Mīr ʿAlī Ḥusaynī; Niẓāmī by Sultan Muhammad Nūr; Saʿdī by Muhammad Qāsim b. Shādīshāh; Sanāʾī (Ḥadīqat al-ḥaqīqa) by Khandan. Painting by Bihzād.
- Gulbenkian 972 AH is the latest datable copy in the corpus. Shelfmark **LA159 confirmed** via online catalog (2026-02-26). Painter: Abdullah al-Shirazi. Origin: Mashhad. Website date "1482–83" refers to poem composition, not copying date.
- Two copies of *Laylī va Majnūn* dated AH 921 are now in the corpus: Sotheby's 2018 lot 58 (125 ff., gold nastaʿlīq, colophon in cloud formations) and Roseberys 2020 lot 13 (21.9 × 12.6 cm, black nastaʿlīq, 15 lines per column in 2 columns). The Roseberys 2021 lot note explicitly cross-references lot 13 as a Khandan work, confirming the two are distinct manuscripts.
- Christie's 2010 lot 174 (*Sayings of Imām ʿAlī*, 15th c. Timurid): contains 3ll. tawqīʿ + 6ll. nastaʿlīq in 2 columns (text panel 19.6 × 11.3 cm; folio 25.7 × 17.2 cm). The Qajar headpiece and red/green morocco binding are later additions over the Timurid core.
- LACMA 1982.120.4 (*Horse and Groom*): the miniature painting (attr. ʿAbd al-Ṣamad) is on the recto; Khandan's white nastaʿlīq calligraphy on the reverse is on a gold ground with gilding by Hāshim Muẓahhib. Probably inserted in the Bahram Mīrzā album compiled by Dust Muḥammad, 1544–45 CE.

**Notes on the catalogued group:**

- BL Delhi Persian 584A (Tazkirat al-awliya, 920 AH, 380 folios) and BL Add. 7753 (Qiran al-Sadayn, 921 AH) together suggest an intense copying programme in 920–921 AH at Herat.
- Rylands Persian MS 842 (*not* at the British Library, *not* dated 921 AH): the "BL Hafiz 921 AH" referenced in some secondary sources appears to be a bibliographic error.
- BL Or 8760 (Divan-i Shahi, catalogued date 888 AH) is omitted from this table pending date verification — 888 AH predates Khandan's confirmed activity by 27 years.
- Kabul National Archive: survival uncertain given decades of political instability.
- TIEM 01942: examined by this project (colophon-verifier, 2026-02-25); no scribal colophon found. Attribution rests entirely on cataloguer's entry.
- Michigan Simpson 13ASIMPSON0460 is an archival photograph in Marianna Shreve Simpson's Islamic manuscript research archive (U-M Library), not a distinct physical manuscript. The Classification Filing Number "Or 11839" identifies it as a record for BL Or 11839 (already in corpus as bl_or_11839). It confirms that Simpson documented Khandan's specimens in that album during her research.
- CBL Per 183 (Bustan 916 AH) is described in the Chester Beatty catalog as "a splendid calligraphic by a master hand." The catalog cites Khandan's death date as 950 AH (from Huart); Bayani contradicts this with manuscripts dated to 957 AH.
- CBL Per 184 (Hafiz 920 AH) is a single folio by the same scribe as CBL Per 183. Illumination described as "of great delicacy and accomplishment."
- The Hazine-i Evkaf group (Istanbul) is the richest single location for Khandan qitʿa specimens: at least 4 named albums (Amir Ghayb Bayg, Bahram Mirza, Sayyid Ahmad Mashhadi, Muhammad Muhsin) plus additional unnamed albums. The Bahram Mirza muraqqa' is Topkapi H.2154 (confirmed via Encyclopaedia Iranica). The Muhammad Muhsin muraqqa' contains the latest dated Khandan specimen (Jumada I 957 AH / 1550 CE).
- The baysunghur.org article (Saadati 2021) is the source for most new entries in this table. It synthesizes Bayani (1966) and other published sources. Items should be verified independently where possible.
- Michigan Isl. Ms. 438 (2026-02-27): A 42-specimen Ottoman calligraphy album (Hutut-ı mütenevvia-yı İslamiye albümü) with pieces dated 914–1317 AH, assembled for Sultan Abdülhamit II. Fully digitized on HathiTrust (public domain). Baysunghur.org attributes the 914 AH date to Khandan's specimen on fol. 2a, but the album contains works by multiple calligraphers and the 914 AH date could belong to another piece. Catalogued by Mamoun Sakkal.
- Berlin Humboldt Forum leaf (2026-02-27): Composite calligraphy leaf (zarnawisht) identified in September 2024 by Muhammad Mahdi Ahadian at an exhibition. Three calligraphers in a master-student chain: Muhammad Husayn Tabrizi, Sultan Ali Mashhadi, and Khandan (Khayyam rubāʿī). Located in Museum für Asiatische Kunst (NOT Museum für Islamische Kunst). No inventory number found online.
- St. Petersburg Navai (935 AH): confirmed at Russian National Library (RNL), not IOM RAS. Dorn catalog numbering system; specific Dorn number unknown.
- Private Paris Yusuf va Zulaykha (923 AH): enriched with Sotheby's Paris 2015 lot 9 details — 11 folios, 2 miniatures, 25×16 cm, €10,000–15,000.
- Bahram Mirza album shelfmark corrected: H.2154 (not H.2156), per Encyclopaedia Iranica.

| bl_hafiz_921 | — | British Library (reported) | Dīwān-i Ḥāfiẓ, 921 AH | **RESOLVED (2026-02-27): bibliographic error.** No evidence found in FIHRIST, BL catalog searches, or web searches. baysunghur.org (Saadati 2021) traces this to Bayani, who places it at "the British Museum, London." The confirmed Hafiz by Khandan is Rylands Persian MS 842 (937 AH, Herat). Most likely a confusion of institution (Rylands ≠ BL) or date (937 ≠ 921). |
| bl_or_8760 | Or 8760 | British Library | Dīwān-i Shāhī, 888 AH | Date 888 AH anomalous — predates Khandan by 27 years. Simpson (*Sultan Ibrahim Mirza's Haft Awrang*) confirms "Shahi dated 888/1483-84 (BL Or. 8760)"; Meredith-Owens 1968 p.56. Appears to be a copying date per catalog convention. Attribution to Khandan unresolved. |

I, pp. 268, 272) attributes tentatively: "may be" Khandan. 127 ff., 14 lines, 8×13 cm, three Timurid illuminated headpieces. If confirmed, earliest dated work (910 AH) and rare Turkish text. |
