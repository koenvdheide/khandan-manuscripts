  "notes": "FALSE POSITIVE. This is NOT a Divan-i Sultan Huseyin Baykara. It is a Fevaid Mecmuasi (miscellany/commonplace book) containing excerpts from many poets (Fuzuli, Jami, Nevi, Attar, etc.). The word 'khandan' appears in the bitish satirlari as a common Persian adjective meaning 'smiling/laughing' in a famous hadith: 'Do you know that when you were born, everyone was khandan and you were crying...' This is an adjectival use, NOT a calligrapher's name or laqab. No copyist is attributed. The manuscript is a compilation of various fawaid (useful notes), manzumat (poems), and iqtibas (excerpts) by multiple hands. Colophon examination not performed as this is clearly unrelated to Sultan Muhammad Khandan."
