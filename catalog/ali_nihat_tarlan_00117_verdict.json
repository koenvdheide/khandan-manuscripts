  "notes": "FALSE POSITIVE. This is Divan-i Shevket by Shevket-i Bukhari (Muhammad b. Ishaq, d. 1107/1695 CE), NOT a divan by Sultan Huseyin Baykara. The word 'khandan' appears in the bitish satirlari as a common Persian adjective meaning 'smiling/happy' in a ghazal couplet: 'daram umid ki khandan bi-durust baz-ayam / an-qadr-ha ki z dargah-i tu giryan raftam' (I hope to return smiling / as much as I left your door weeping). Standard poetic antithesis khandan/giryan. Author post-dates Khandan by over a century. No copyist is attributed. Colophon examination not performed as this is clearly unrelated to Sultan Muhammad Khandan."
