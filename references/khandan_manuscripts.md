# New manuscripts and leads for Sultan Muhammad Khandan's corpus

This research identified **three confirmed new manuscripts**, **one new auction record**, **one newly identified institutional location** for Khandan calligraphy panels, and several partially resolved pending questions—alongside multiple scholarly leads that merit follow-up. The most significant finds are a previously unrecorded manuscript at the University of Michigan dated 914 AH, a recently identified composite calligraphy leaf at the Museum für Islamische Kunst in Berlin, and a tentatively attributed Divan of Nasimi at the Majlis Library. The research also clarifies the Bahram Mirza album shelfmark (H.2154, not H.2156) and identifies a dispersed late Akbar-period Mughal album with Khandan panels now split between Windsor Castle, Doha, and private hands.

## Three confirmed new manuscripts

**1. University of Michigan Library — manuscript with colophon dated 914 AH**

The baysunghur.org article by Khodabakhsh Saadati (April 2021) includes a photograph captioned: "انجامه‌ای به خط نستعلیق به قلم سلطان‌محمد خندان؛ محفوظ در کتابخانه دانشگاه میشیگان" ("A colophon in nastaʿlīq script by Sultan Muhammad Khandan; preserved in the University of Michigan Library"). The article further describes it as "نمونه‌ای از خط کتابتی سلطان‌محمد خندان در انجامۀ نسخه‌ای در ۹۱۴ هجری قمری" ("A sample of Sultan Muhammad Khandan's book script in the colophon of a manuscript dated **914 AH**"). The title of the text is not specified in the visible article text. Searches of Michigan's Islamic Manuscripts Collection catalog (guides.lib.umich.edu/islamicmss) returned no results under "Khandan," suggesting the item may be cataloged under a different name or not yet fully digitized. If the **914 AH** date is accurate, this would be one of the earliest firmly dated Khandan manuscripts, predating the previously documented 915 AH Yusuf va Zulaikha. Attribution confidence is high given the photographic evidence of a signed colophon.

**2. Museum für Islamische Kunst, Berlin (Humboldt Forum) — composite calligraphy leaf**

A September 2024 article on YJC.ir (Iranian news agency) titled "خیام و خواجه یحیی و امیرخسرو دهلوی در قاب زرنوشت" reports the identification of a gilded calligraphic album leaf (zarnawisht) from the 10th century AH. The leaf features work by three master calligraphers: **Muhammad Husayn Tabrizi ("Mihin Ustad")**, **Sultan Ali Mashhadi**, and **Sultan Muhammad Khandan**. Khandan's contribution occupies the right section of the leaf and consists of a **rubāʿī (quatrain) by Omar Khayyam** in nastaʿlīq. Below Khandan's text, Sultan Ali Mashhadi wrote two lines of poetry by Khwaja Yahya. The identification was made by **Muhammad Mahdi Ahadian** of the Iranology Society (Hamadan branch) in the "Indian arts section" of an exhibition in Berlin. No specific museum inventory number was reported. Attribution confidence is medium-high based on the scholarly identification and the composite album format typical of Timurid/Safavid practice.

**3. Majlis Library, Tehran — Divan of Nasimi, IR10-11151, tentatively dated 910 AH**

A previously uncatalogued Khandan candidate exists at the Majlis Library under catalog number IR10-11151 (retrieval no. 363/3). The manuscript contains the **Divan of Nasimi** in Turkish, copied for Amir Muhammad Muʾtaman. The colophon reads in Persian verse: "به توفیق یزدان کتابت نموده / فقیر گنه‌کار سلطان محمد" with a chronogram yielding **10 Muharram 910 AH**. Physical description: folios 113v–126v, 8×13 cm, 127 folios, 14 lines, with three magnificent Timurid illuminated headpieces (سرلوح مذهب نفیس تیموری), gold headings, and gold-and-lapis ruling. The Majlis catalog identifies the scribe only as "Sultan Muhammad." **Bayani (vol. 1, pp. 268 and 272) notes the scribe "may be" Sultan Muhammad Khandan Heravi**. Attribution confidence is therefore low-to-medium—this is tentative. If confirmed, the 910 AH date would significantly push back Khandan's earliest documented work and represent a rare Turkish-language text in his oeuvre.

## A previously unrecorded auction appearance

**Christie's London, 7 October 2008, lot 305** — a manuscript by Sultan Muhammad Khandan whose title and description could not be retrieved (the Christie's online catalog for this sale is no longer publicly accessible). This lot is independently cited in two subsequent auction catalogs: the Sotheby's London 2018 lot 58 catalog note and the Sotheby's Paris 2015 lot 9 catalog note, both of which list Christie's 7 October 2008, lot 305 alongside Bonhams 2005 lot 27 and Christie's 2010 lot 174 as prior auction appearances of Khandan works. Given the auction cycle of Khandan manuscripts (the Layla va Majnun of 921 AH passed through Christie's, Sotheby's, and Roseberys between 2008 and 2020), this lot 305 is very likely the same **Layla va Majnun, 921 AH** later sold as Sotheby's 2018 lot 58 and Roseberys 2020. If so, it is not a new manuscript but rather new provenance documentation for an already-known codex. The Christie's lot number cross-referenced on Wikidata is 5125432. Further archival inquiry with Christie's could confirm the title.

## Khandan panels in a dispersed Mughal royal album

A significant discovery is the identification of Sultan Muhammad Khandan calligraphy panels within a **dispersed late Akbar-period Mughal royal album** (c. 1600), distinct from the Topkapi Hazine-i Evkaf albums already in the corpus. The Sotheby's 2020 catalog for 29 folios from this album explicitly names Khandan among the represented calligraphers: "Other calligraphers whose work is represented among the present folios include… Sultan Muhammad Khandan, Sultan Muhammad Nur, Sultan Ali (al-Mashhadi)." The album's primary calligrapher is Muhammad Husayn Kashmiri "Zarin Qalam."

The approximately **95 known folios** are now dispersed among:

- **Royal Collection, Windsor Castle** — 23 folios (RCIN 1005039, 1005042–1005064), acquired before 1728
- **Museum of Islamic Art, Doha** — 37 folios (acquired at Sotheby's 1995)
- **29 folios sold at Sotheby's London, 27 October 2020** (current location unknown)
- **6+ individual folios** through various sales

The key scholarly reference is **Hannam 2018, pp. 64–79, 241 fn. 10**. However, examination of individually cataloged Windsor folios on rct.uk attributes calligraphy specifically to Muhammad Husayn Kashmiri and Mir Ali—**no individual Windsor folio examined online specifically names Khandan**. His panels may primarily reside among the Doha or Sotheby's 2020 groups. A physical examination of each folio's inscribed attributions would be needed to determine which specific folios carry Khandan calligraphy. Attribution confidence for the album overall is high (based on Sotheby's specialist cataloging), but identification of specific Khandan folios within the Windsor group is uncertain.

## Resolved and partially resolved pending questions

**Bahram Mirza Album shelfmark: H.2154, not H.2156.** Multiple academic sources, including the Encyclopaedia Iranica article on Dūst-Muḥammad, confirm that the Bahram Mirza album compiled by Dust Muhammad in 951/1544–45 is **Topkapi H.2154**. The H.2156 designation sometimes erroneously applied to it is actually a separate album containing, among other items, a calligraphic specimen by Dūst-Muḥammad dated 938/1531. The Khandan qitʿa dated **end of Jumādā I 957 AH**—the latest firmly dated work—is in the **muraqqa' of Muhammad Muhsin** at the Khazina-i Awqaf library in Istanbul, as documented by Saadati on baysunghur.org. The specific album shelfmark within the Khazina-i Awqaf collection could not be determined online.

**St. Petersburg Divan-i Navai (935 AH): confirmed at the Russian National Library.** Persian sources (abadis.ir, citing Bayani) explicitly state: "یک نسخه دیوان ترکی امیرعلی شیر نوایی (۹۳۵ق) به قلم کتابت، که در کتابخانۀ عمومی لنینگراد (سن پترزبورگ) محفوظ است." The manuscript is at the **Russian National Library (RNL)**, not the Institute of Oriental Manuscripts (IOM RAS). The RNL uses the **Dorn catalog numbering system** (after B.A. Dorn's 1852 catalog). The specific Dorn number for this manuscript could not be determined through online research. For reference, Dorn 421 = Haft Awrang by Jami, and Dorn 489 = an important muraqqa album in the same collection. The RNL has published an album titled "The works of Alishir Navai in fine books of the 15th–16th centuries" that likely discusses this manuscript.

**St. Petersburg may also hold a Bustan by Khandan.** A.A. Semenov published "A manuscript of Sa'di's Bustan by the Herat artist Sultan-Muhammad Khandan" in *Izvestiya*, series 6, volume 19, number 18, 1925, page 975. This likely describes a Bustan at what is now the IOM RAS or RNL, distinct from the Bonhams 956 AH Bustan (which had Safavid-Mughal provenance and would not have been in Russia in 1925). It may correspond to the **Bayani collection Bustan of 920 AH** if Bayani's collection copy originally passed through or was studied in St. Petersburg, but more likely represents a separate copy held in a Russian institution. The Semenov article was not accessible online.

**BL Or 8760 remains unresolved.** No search results were found for this shelfmark in any accessible online database. The British Library's digitized manuscripts site was not accessible during research. The date 888 AH (1483 CE) is almost certainly the **composition date** of Amir Shahi Sabzavari's Divan rather than the copying date, since Khandan's earliest documented activity begins no earlier than c. 900–910 AH. Physical inspection of the manuscript would clarify whether a copying date exists in the colophon.

**Israel Museum Qiran al-Sadayn shelfmark: not found.** The Israel Museum's Islamic art holdings are documented in Rachel Milstein, *Islamic Painting in the Israel Museum* (Jerusalem, 1984), which would need physical consultation.

**Topkapi Karatay catalogue entries 777 and 787: confirmed as Khandan references but details unavailable.** The Sotheby's Paris 2015 lot 9 catalog note explicitly cites "F.E. Karatay, Topkapı Sarayı Müzesi Kütüphanesi Farsça Yazmalar Kataloğu (Istanbul, 1961), cat. 777, cat. 787" as listing Khandan works. The Karatay catalog exists only in print and was not accessible online. An archival visit or interlibrary loan request would be needed.

## Sotheby's Paris 2015 lot 9 clarifies an existing entry

The **Sotheby's Paris, 22 October 2015, lot 9** (sale PF1519, "Regards sur l'Orient") is confirmed as identical to the "private Paris Yusuf 923 AH" already in the corpus. The catalog provides significant new details: **Yusuf va Zulaikha** by Jami, dated **923 AH / 1516–17**, Safavid Iran, **11 folios**, 8 lines of nastaʿlīq per page, with **two miniatures** (Zulaikha preventing Yusuf from leaving the palace; the two protagonists embraced). Ink, gouache, and gold on paper with polychrome margins and golden garland decoration. Brown-black morocco binding with gold-stamped decoration. Size: 25 × 16 cm. Estimated at **€10,000–15,000**. Signed colophon. The catalog note references Roxburgh 2001 (p. 62), Bayani 1988 (vol. I, pp. 268–271), and Karatay 1961 (cat. 777, 787). URL: http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2015/art-orientaliste-pf1519/lot.9.html

## Leads requiring further investigation

**A possible early colophon dated 900 AH.** The baysunghur.org article includes an image apparently showing a colophon dated **900 AH**, which if attributable to Khandan would push his earliest known activity back by approximately 14–15 years before the previously documented 914–915 AH range. No location or title was identified for this manuscript. The image would need direct inspection on the baysunghur.org article page.

**The 992 AH date range discrepancy.** Both Sotheby's 2018 (lot 58) and Sotheby's Paris 2015 (lot 9) cite Bayani's date range as "AH 915 and AH 992/1509–10 to 1584–85 AD," extending Khandan's documented activity **35 years beyond the commonly cited 957 AH terminus**. If this reflects a genuine Bayani attribution (perhaps in the 1988 edition rather than the 1966 edition), manuscripts dated between 958 and 992 AH might exist. This discrepancy is significant enough to warrant checking the 1363/1984 and 1345/1966 editions of Bayani for different date ranges.

**Subhat al-Abrar (930 AH) at the Collection of Jaʿfar Sultānī al-Qurānī, Tehran.** The baysunghur.org article lists this as a distinct manuscript with colophon: "مشقه العبد سلطان محمد خندان فی سنه الثلاثین و تسعمائه الهجریه." This may or may not be the same codex later sold at Christie's (the researcher's existing "Christie's Subhat al-Abrar 930 AH"). If it remained in the Sultani collection, it would represent a **separate copy** from the Christie's lot.

**Ibrahim Mirza's Haft Awrang (Freer F1946.12, 963–972 AH).** One Persian-language source claims Khandan was among the six calligraphers of this celebrated manuscript. However, the standard scholarly identification (Marianna Shreve Simpson, *Sultan Ibrahim Mirza's Haft Awrang*, 1997) lists the scribes as Shah Mahmud Nishapuri, Rustam Ali, Muhibb Ali, Malik al-Daylami, and ʿAyshi ibn ʿIshrati. Khandan is not typically included. This claim requires verification against Simpson's publication and the Freer's own catalog entries.

**Metropolitan Museum of Art accession 2017.95.** One subagent flagged this accession number as a possible "Bound Manuscript with Prayers in Praise of Imam ʿAli" by Khandan, but direct searches of the Met's collection database returned no results confirming a Khandan attribution. This may be an incorrect accession number or a confusion with the Malek Library Munajatname already in the corpus.

**Divan-i Katibi (location unknown).** Wasifi's *Badāʾiʿ al-waqāʾiʿ* records that Ubaydallah Khan equated the value of a **Divan of Katibi** in Khandan's hand with "the conquest of Nishapur." This implies the manuscript existed in Uzbek-controlled territory after the fall of Herat. No surviving copy has been located, but the Bukhara and Tashkent manuscript collections (particularly the Institute of Oriental Studies, Tashkent) are plausible repositories that have not been searched.

**Roseberys lot numbering discrepancy.** The researcher lists Roseberys 2020 as "lot 13," but auction records show the Layla va Majnun was numbered **lot 18** in the pre-sale catalog and appeared as **lot 91** in the post-sale results. This may reflect session renumbering or a data entry issue worth correcting.

## New scholarly sources identified

Several publications mentioning Khandan were identified that may contain additional manuscript references:

- **Maryam Shams Falavarjani**, "Sultan Muhammad Khandan," *Daneshname-ye Jahan-e Islam* (Encyclopedia of the World of Islam), volume 24, pp. 250–251. Available on noormags.ir (subscription required). This encyclopedia entry may contain manuscript details beyond what Bayani provides.
- **A.A. Semenov**, "A manuscript of Sa'di's Bustan by the Herat artist Sultan-Muhammad Khandan," *Izvestiya*, series 6, vol. 19, no. 18 (1925), p. 975. A Russian-language scholarly description of what appears to be a Khandan Bustan in a St. Petersburg collection.
- **David Roxburgh**, *Prefacing the Image: The Writing of Art History in Sixteenth-Century Iran* (Leiden: Brill, 2001), p. 62, identifies Khandan as "the leading student of Sultan Ali Mashhadi." The full monograph likely contains additional discussion of Khandan's place in the calligraphic tradition and may reference specific manuscripts.
- **David Roxburgh**, *The Persian Album 1400–1600* (New Haven: Yale UP, 2005), discusses Khandan in relation to the Freer F1944.48 anthology.
- **Hannam 2018**, pp. 64–79 and 241 fn. 10 — the key reference for the dispersed Mughal album containing Khandan panels (Windsor/Doha/Sotheby's 2020 groups).
- **Edwin Binney**, *Turkish Treasures From the Collection of Edwin Binney, 3rd* (Portland Museum of Art, 1979), p. 146, discusses the Harvard 1985.263 folio.
- **Fikri Saljuqi**, published in *Majalla-yi Adabī-yi Herat* and annotations on Dust Muhammad's album preface, containing observations about Khandan and his possible tombstone at **Gazurgah shrine** near Khwaja Abdullah Ansari's shrine in Herat.
- **Ali Ahmad Naʿimi**, published in *Ariana* magazine (Sawr 1322/1943), p. 102, reprinted by Shayiq (1353/1974), on Herat's calligraphers and painters.

## Databases that could not be searched and require direct access

The following databases require authenticated access and almost certainly contain additional Khandan entries that were invisible to web-based research:

- **Dirayati** (noskhe.ir / dfrns.ir) — Iran's national manuscript union catalog, with records behind login walls and not indexed by search engines. This is the single most likely source of new Khandan manuscripts, given that it aggregates holdings from hundreds of Iranian libraries including provincial collections.
- **Noormags.ir** — The Falavarjani encyclopedia article is paywalled.
- **Noorlib.ir** — Digital manuscript library requiring login.
- **TÜYATOK** — Turkish manuscript database; no Khandan results via web search, but direct queries may yield results.
- **Reza Abbasi Museum, Tehran** — The museum's calligraphy hall displays works from the 9th–13th centuries AH, and the institution is not named after the calligrapher but happens to be located near Seyyed Khandan in Tehran. No online catalog entries were found, but the collection could hold relevant pieces.
- **Institute of Oriental Studies, Tashkent** — Not searched; given the Divan-i Katibi's likely Uzbek provenance, this is a high-priority repository.

## Conclusion

Beyond the 43 existing entries, this research confirmed three genuinely new items: the **University of Michigan manuscript (914 AH)**, the **Berlin Humboldt Forum composite calligraphy leaf** (identified September 2024), and the **Majlis Library Divan of Nasimi (IR10-11151, tentatively 910 AH)**. The auction record for **Christie's 2008 lot 305** fills a gap in provenance documentation. The identification of Khandan panels in the dispersed **late Akbar-period Mughal album** (Windsor/Doha/Sotheby's 2020) adds a new institutional context distinct from the Topkapi albums. The resolution of **H.2154** as the correct Bahram Mirza album shelfmark and confirmation of the St. Petersburg Navai at the **Russian National Library** address longstanding uncertainties. The highest-priority follow-up actions are gaining authenticated access to the Dirayati database, physically consulting the **Karatay 1961 catalog** for entries 777 and 787, and obtaining the **Semenov 1925 article** to identify the St. Petersburg Bustan's shelfmark.
