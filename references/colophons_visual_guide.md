## Ottoman colophons: from Şeyh Hamdullah to the 18th century

Ottoman colophons frequently employ **dīwānī script** for the colophon text even when the manuscript body is in naskh — a distinctive feature worth noting visually. Several outstanding examples are digitized:

**Walters W.672 — Album of Ottoman Calligraphy by Şeyh Hamdullah (d. 1520 CE)**
The most historically significant Ottoman colophon available online. The great calligrapher wrote: "This was written by Ḥamdu Llāh, known as the sheikh's son… at the time of his hoariness as his hair glistened white and his head trembled… being 80 and some odd years old."

## Timurid colophons: Herat and Shiraz's golden age of bookmaking

## Mamluk colophons: royal Qur'ans and military treatises

Mamluk colophons are often found in **monumental Qur'an volumes** and tend to include detailed commissioning certificates naming the patron, scribe, and illuminators. Several iconic examples survive.

The finest surviving Mamluk Qur'an — seven volumes totaling over **2,000 digitized pages**.

## Conclusion

The landscape of digitized Islamic colophons is remarkably rich. **Safavid-era manuscripts** dominate the accessible corpus — the Walters Art Museum alone has over a dozen directly linkable Safavid colophon pages. **Timurid colophons** are best represented by the Baysunghur Shahnameh PDF on Wikimedia and several outstanding examples at the Met. **Mamluk colophons** center on the monumental Baybars Qur'an at the British Library and Chester Beatty's Qur'an scrolls. **Ottoman colophons** are comparatively underrepresented in tagged digital collections, though the Şeyh Hamdullah album at the Walters and Leiden's 1520 Qur'an are excellent starting points.

One practical insight: colophon pages in digital viewers are almost always located in the **final folios** of a manuscript, so when browsing any digitized Islamic manuscript, navigate to the last pages first. The Walters Art Museum's systematic tagging of individual colophon folios remains the exception — at most institutions, colophons are embedded within full manuscript scans without individual page labels. The Shah Tahmasp Shahnameh, often considered the greatest illustrated Islamic manuscript ever produced, is a notable gap: its colophon page is **lost**, a fact worth knowing for anyone compiling visual examples of Safavid colophons.
