# Search-Term Strategy for the Calligrapher خندان in the Turkish YEK Manuscript Portal

## Executive summary

The name **خندان** (“Khandān/Khondān,” literally “smiling”) is best treated, for manuscript-search purposes, as a **laqab/moniker** that can appear **alone** or as part of the fuller historical name **Sultan Muhammad Khandan**—a prolific **nastaʿlīq/taʿlīq** scribe associated with **Herat** and patronage circles around **Mir ʿAli Shir Navaʾi**. citeturn9view1turn9view2turn11view0

For effective discovery in the Turkish YEK portal, rely on **three parallel search tracks** (often run as separate searches if the interface does not support Boolean logic inside one field):

1) **Name-variants track**: search خندان plus high-yield companions like سلطان, محمد, هروی / Heravî, and Turkish/Latin transliterations (Handan, Hândân, Khandan, Ḫandân). citeturn9view1turn11view0  
2) **Colophon/signature track**: search for short, stable signature kernels that recur in authentic inscriptions, such as **العبد … خندان**, **كتبه … خندان**, **حرره … خندان**, **فقیر … خندان** (always keeping خندان in the query to avoid overwhelming results). citeturn10view1turn11view0  
3) **Metadata-field track**: run the above terms inside the portal’s most productive fields—especially **Nüshayla ilgili kişiler** (copyist/calligrapher and other agents) and **Mühürler ve Kayıtlar** (ownership and documentary notes, including colophon-like entries)—because the portal supports Arabic-letter searching in those fields. citeturn7view0

The portal documentation (as publicly summarized by a Turkish university library) indicates that (a) Arabic-script searching can work in several person- and record-related fields and (b) search is not sensitive to circumflex/case differences (e.g., diacritics and capitalization are not decisive), so you should run both “plain” and “fully vocalized/diacritic” spellings without worrying about exact orthography. citeturn7view0

## Target identity that most cataloguers mean by خندان

In Islamic art and manuscript cataloguing, “Khandan/Khondan” most commonly points to **entity["people","Sultan Muhammad Khandan","herat nasta'liq scribe"]**, described in major auction and museum catalogues as:

- a leading student of **entity["people","Sultan 'Ali Mashhadi","persian calligrapher d 1520"],citeturn9view1  
- active/recorded through dated works roughly **915–992 AH (1509–10 to 1584–85 CE)** in a standard scholarly tradition (often citing **entity["people","Mehdi Bayani","iranian calligraphy historian"] and catalogues such as Karatay),citeturn9view1turn9view2  
- associated with **entity["people","Mir 'Ali Shir Nava'i","timurid poet patron"] early in his career and with **Herat** as a primary geographic anchor. citeturn9view1turn9view2turn11view0  

Because **خندان** is also a common adjective/nickname and “Handan” is a modern Turkish given name, search specificity is essential: in practice, you will do better starting with **سلطان محمد خندان** (and close variants) than with **خندان** alone. citeturn7view0turn9view1turn9view2

## Variant name spellings and transliterations to try

The table below prioritizes **forms likely to appear in cataloguer-entered metadata**, colophons transcribed into the record, and Latin-script authority headings. (You do not need to over-optimize diacritics/circumflex; the portal guidance suggests those distinctions are not decisive for search matching.) citeturn7view0

### Variant spellings table

| Language/context | Script | High-yield variants to try (exact strings) | When to use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Arabic/Persian basic | Arabic script | خندان | Broad net; use only when paired with other constraints (field, date, script) |
| Arabic/Persian fuller name | Arabic script | سلطان محمد خندان ; سلطان‌محمد خندان | Best first-line query for the well-known Herat scribe citeturn9view1turn11view0 |
| Arabic/Persian with nisba | Arabic script | خندان هروی ; سلطان محمد خندان هروی | Disambiguation from other “Khandan” names; useful if cataloguer includes nisba |
| Arabic-script honorific form | Arabic script | مولانا سلطان محمد خندان ; مولانا خندان | If cataloguer copied biographical phrasing (e.g., from tazkiras) citeturn11view0 |
| Ottoman Turkish catalog-style | Latin (Turkish) | Sultan Muhammed Handan ; Sultan Muhammed Hândân | Turkish transcription conventions; helps if Arabic-script fields aren’t indexed as expected citeturn7view0turn9view1 |
| Scholarly Latin transliteration | Latin | Sultan Muhammad Khandan ; Sultan Muhammad Khondan | Common in English-language secondary records citeturn9view1turn9view2 |
| Library-style diacritic Latin | Latin | Sulṭān Muḥammad Ḫandān ; Ḫandân | If records follow a diacritic-heavy scheme; still worth trying even if portal normalizes diacritics citeturn7view0 |
| Reduced forms | Latin / Arabic script | Muhammad Khandan ; محمد خندان | Useful if records omit the title “Sultan” |

## High-yield signature and colophon keywords that travel well across records

When a manuscript record includes transcription of the colophon/ketebe statement (often under “records/notes” fields), the strongest search terms are **short, stable kernels** that recur in authentic signed material.

### Core signature kernels

Use these as “anchors,” ideally with خندان present in the same query:

- **العبد … خندان** (e.g., al-ʿabd + name) — attested in a museum inscription that explicitly records “al-ʿabd Sultan Muhammad Khandan,” making this an excellent phrase-family to target. citeturn10view1  
- **كتبه … خندان** (“katabahu/ketebe … Khandan”) — repeatedly attested in discussions of his signed works and gives a compact “colophon-like” string that cataloguers may transcribe. citeturn11view0  
- **حرره … خندان** (“harrarahu …”) — also explicitly attested in museum inscriptions connected to signed pieces. citeturn10view1  
- **فقیر … خندان / الفقير … خندان** — humility formulas occur in reported signatures and can be searchable if recorded verbatim. citeturn11view0  

### Ottoman Turkish equivalents sometimes used in records

Some records describe colophon content using Turkish terms rather than quoting Arabic/Persian text. Therefore, also try Turkish metadata words as *contextual* keywords (especially if you are searching in Turkish UI fields):

- **ketebe kaydı / ketebe** (colophon note), **istinsah**, **müstensih**, **hattat**, **hüsn-i hat**, **muraqqa/murakka** (album), **kıt‘a/kit’a** (calligraphic piece), **meşk** (practice sheet).  
These help when records are indexed by Turkish description rather than direct Arabic-script transcription, and they align with the portal’s field structure emphasizing manuscript agents and record types. citeturn7view0

### Script and format terms most diagnostic for this name

Auction catalogue notes repeatedly frame Khandan primarily as a **nastaʿlīq** (often catalogued in Turkey under **taʿlîk / nestaʿlîk**) scribe. citeturn9view1turn9view2  
Accordingly, you get better signal if you combine name-queries with:

- **Yazı türü = taʿlîk / nestaʿlîk / nastaʿlîq** (or the portal’s closest controlled term). citeturn9view1turn9view2  
- **Form = murakkaʿ/album, kıtʿa** (because many signed specimens survive as album folios/panels, and at least one museum record describing a signed panel is in that genre). citeturn10view1turn11view0  

## YEK portal fields and filters to target, based on public portal guidance

A published Turkish-library guidance page summarizing the YEK portal explains several specifics that matter directly for your query planning:

- The portal supports **Basit Arama** (search across fields) and **Detaylı Arama** (multiple rules/headers; add additional “kural”/rules). citeturn7view0  
- It states that search is not sensitive to circumflex/case differences, illustrated with examples where different diacritic/case forms return the same result. citeturn7view0  
- It explicitly states that **Arabic-letter searching** can return results in key manuscript-person and record fields, including **eser and author name**, **müstensih**, **mütemellik** and other persons, **beginning/ending lines**, and **istinsah record fields**. citeturn7view0  
- It also gives a practical map of “what goes where” in advanced search:  
  - **Müellif adı** can include not only authors but also translator/commentator roles;  
  - **Nüshayla ilgili kişiler** includes roles like **müstensih, vâkıf, mütemellik, hattat, müzehhip, mücellit**;  
  - **Mühürler ve Kayıtlar** includes vakıf and personal seals and documentary notes such as temellük, vakıf, kıraat, sema. citeturn7view0  

These points justify a workflow where you prioritize **Nüshayla ilgili kişiler** and **Mühürler ve Kayıtlar** for “Khandan” discovery, rather than relying only on title/author fields. citeturn7view0

## Suggested YEK search queries with expected results

If the portal does **not** support Boolean logic inside a single field, treat each row below as a **separate run** under Detaylı Arama, keeping the field choice stable and varying the query string.

### Query strategy table

| Search objective | Field to target | Exact query string(s) to try | Expected “good hit” pattern |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fast, precise capture of the main identity | Nüshayla ilgili kişiler | سلطان محمد خندان ; Sultan Muhammed Handan ; Sultan Muhammad Khandan | Record lists copyist/calligrapher with a close match; often Persian manuscript; frequently taʿlîk/nastaʿlîq noted citeturn7view0turn9view1 |
| Catch records that omit “Sultan” | Nüshayla ilgili kişiler | محمد خندان ; Muhammed Handan ; Muhammad Khandan | Same as above but without the title; helps when cataloguer treated “Sultan” as honorific and dropped it |
| Capture Arabic-script-only entries | Nüshayla ilgili kişiler AND Mühürler ve Kayıtlar (run separately) | خندان | Many false positives unless constrained; use in combination with date/script filters citeturn7view0 |
| Mine colophon transcriptions for stable signature kernels | Mühürler ve Kayıtlar (or istinsah/ketebe-related record area, if separately exposed) | كتبه خندان ; العبد خندان ; حرره خندان ; فقیر خندان | “Good hit” usually shows a copied colophon/ketebe line; verify that خندان is attached to a personal name, not an adjective citeturn10view1turn11view0 |
| Disambiguate from modern Turkish “Handan” noise | Nüshayla ilgili kişiler | خندان هروی ; Sultan Muhammed Handan Heravi | Hits skew toward Persianate manuscripts; modern Turkish given-name noise should drop |
| Align with known geography anchor | Any field that indexes place (İstinsah Yeri / Place, if available) + name field | Herat / هرات + خندان (as separate rules) | Stronger when combined with a person-name rule; Khandan is repeatedly associated with Herat in catalog literature citeturn9view1turn9view2turn11view0 |
| Constrain by attested activity window | Date filter (İstinsah Tarihi) + name field | 900–1000 AH (or 1500–1600 CE) + (سلطان محمد خندان / خندان) | Should elevate plausible attributions; auction/catalog literature commonly reports recorded works across 915–992 AH citeturn9view1turn9view2 |
| Constrain by script most associated with the scribe | Yazı türü + name field | taʿlîk / nastaʿlîq (portal controlled term) + خندان | Expected: Persian manuscript/calligraphy; reduces false positives from other “Khandan/Handan” persons citeturn9view1turn9view2 |

## Disambiguation pitfalls and verification keywords

### Common confusions you should anticipate in search design

A recurrent scholarly caution is confusion between **Khandan** and near-contemporary names in the same milieu, especially **Sultan Muhammad Nur**; at least one secondary discussion reports earlier writers conflating attributes of “Khandan” with “Nur,” and explicitly frames this as an identification problem. citeturn11view0  
Practically, this means:

- if you find a record where the calligrapher is given as “Sultan Muhammad …” but the second element varies (خندان vs نور), treat it as a **candidate confusion case** and compare signatures/colophons carefully;  
- consider running a **parallel control search** for **سلطان محمد نور** so you can recognize shared/borderline records and avoid collapsing two different hands into one.

### Verification checklist terms

When you open a promising manuscript record (or image), “Khandan-positive” indicators that can be searched and also used for manual confirmation are:

- presence of an explicit signature phrase like **العبد سلطان محمد خندان** (or a close variant), which is attested verbatim in a museum inscription record; citeturn10view1  
- colophon verbs such as **كتبه** or **حرره** near the name, which recur in reported signatures of his work; citeturn10view1turn11view0  
- a script identification consistent with the catalog tradition describing him as a nastaʿlīq/taʿlīq specialist. citeturn9view1turn9view2
