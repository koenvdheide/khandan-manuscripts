# Sultan Muhammad Khandan (d. after 972/1564): A Corpus of Manuscripts by a Nastaʿliq Master of the Herat School

**Abstract.** Sultan Muhammad Khandan (سلطان محمد خندان), a leading nastaʿlīq calligrapher of the late Timurid and early Safavid periods, has never been the subject of a dedicated catalog study in any language. This paper presents the first consolidated and structured corpus of his known manuscripts, comprising 48 entries assembled from digital manuscript portals, union catalogs, museum collections, auction records, and published bibliographic sources. The methodology combined systematic searches of Turkey's YEK portal (Yazma Eserler Kurumu Başkanlığı) and the UK's FIHRIST union catalog with a broader sweep of institutional and commercial catalogs worldwide. Where digitized manuscripts were available, colophon verification was attempted using high-resolution IIIF images. Of 48 entries, only one colophon could be independently confirmed through visual inspection — an *Ilāhīnāma* at the Istanbul Archaeological Museums (Arkeoloji 00153). The corpus spans at least 57 years of documented activity (915–972 AH / 1509–1564 CE) — or 62 years if a tentative 910 AH attribution is accepted — encompasses 18 distinct texts across codices and calligraphic specimens (*qiṭʿa*), and is now dispersed among institutions and private collections in 11 countries. The overwhelming dependence on a single bibliographic source — Mahdī Bayānī's *Aḥwāl va Āsār-i Khwushnivīsān* (1966) — and the near-total absence of digitized images for Khandan manuscripts outside Turkey constitute the most significant limitations. The corpus nevertheless establishes the documentary foundation for future studies of this important but understudied figure in the Herat calligraphic tradition.

## 1. Introduction

The history of Persian calligraphy in the later Timurid period (ca. 850–920 AH / 1446–1514 CE) is dominated by the figure of Sultan ʿAlī Mashhadī (d. 926/1519–20), the master who elevated nastaʿlīq from a chancery hand to the pre-eminent script of literary manuscript production.[^1] Sultan ʿAlī's students and successors carried this tradition into the Safavid era and beyond, yet they have received comparatively little scholarly attention. Among these successors, **Sultan Muhammad Khandan** (خندان, "the smiling one") stands out as one of the most prolific and highly regarded, mentioned by contemporary and near-contemporary sources as a leading exponent of the Herat school.[^2] Despite this reputation, no dedicated catalog of his manuscripts has been published in any language, whether Persian, Turkish, or a Western language.

[^1]: On Sultan ʿAlī Mashhadī's pivotal role, see David J. Roxburgh, *Prefacing the Image: The Writing of Art History in Sixteenth-Century Iran* (Leiden: Brill, 2001), 62; and Qāḍī Aḥmad, *Gulistān-i Hunar*, trans. V. Minorsky as *Calligraphers and Painters* (Washington, DC: Freer Gallery of Art, 1959), 130–35.

[^2]: Roxburgh identifies Khandan as "the leading student of Sultan Ali Mashhadi" (*Prefacing the Image*, 62).

The principal source for Khandan's biography and manuscript list remains Mahdī Bayānī's *Aḥwāl va Āsār-i Khwushnivīsān* (vol. I, Tehran, 1345 sh / 1966, pp. 268–271), a biographical dictionary of Persian calligraphers. Bayānī drew on earlier *taẕkira* literature, particularly Qāḍī Aḥmad's *Gulistān-i Hunar* (completed ca. 1005/1596–97), Khvāndamīr's *Ḥabīb al-Siyar*, and Vāṣifī's *Badāʾiʿ al-Waqāʾiʿ*. Clément Huart's *Les Calligraphes et les Miniaturistes de l'Orient Musulman* (Paris, 1908, p. 224) provides a brief earlier notice, recording Khandan's death date as 950 AH — a date contradicted by manuscripts in the present corpus dated as late as 972 AH. In Persian, the most recent treatment is Khodabakhsh Saadati's online article on baysunghur.org (April 2021), which synthesizes Bayānī with other published sources and provides photographs of several colophons.[^3] No Western-language study has attempted to assemble Khandan's complete manuscript corpus.

The present study aims to fill this gap. It draws on four categories of sources: (1) Turkey's national manuscript portal, the Yazma Eserler Kurumu Başkanlığı (YEK), searched exhaustively across four sessions; (2) the FIHRIST union catalog of Islamic manuscripts in UK collections; (3) online catalogs and publications of museums and auction houses worldwide; and (4) the published bibliographic literature, principally Bayānī via intermediaries. The resulting corpus of 48 entries — ranging from complete codices to single-leaf calligraphic specimens (*qiṭʿa*) — constitutes the first consolidated inventory of Khandan's known output and provides a foundation for future art-historical and codicological study.

## 2. The Calligrapher

### 2.1 Biographical Outline

Sultan Muhammad Khandan was born in Herat, likely in the second half of the ninth century AH (fifteenth century CE). He was a student of Sultan ʿAlī Mashhadī, the pre-eminent nastaʿlīq calligrapher of the Timurid court, and was active within the patronage circle of Mīr ʿAlī Shīr Navāʾī (d. 906/1501), the great Chagatay Turkish poet and patron of arts and letters. The *taẕkira* sources describe Khandan as among Sultan ʿAlī's most distinguished pupils, alongside Sultan Muhammad Nūr (نور) and Mīr ʿAlī Ḥarawī.[^4]

[^4]: For the Herat calligraphic circle, see Roxburgh, *Prefacing the Image*, 58–63; Qāḍī Aḥmad / Minorsky, *Calligraphers and Painters*, 130–45.

The earliest securely dated manuscript in the corpus is a *Yūsuf va Zulaykha* of Jāmī from 915 AH / 1509–10 CE (private collection, Tehran), though a tentatively attributed *Dīwān-i Nasīmī* at the Majlis Library, Tehran (IR10-11151), bears a colophon chronogram of 910 AH / 1504 CE.[^5] The latest dated work is a *Subḥat al-Abrār* of Jāmī from 972 AH / 1564 CE, now in the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, Lisbon (shelfmark LA159). This gives a minimum documented activity span of 57 years — an unusually long career, suggesting Khandan lived into his eighties or beyond. Bayānī cites an outer date of 992 AH / 1584 CE, though no dated manuscript from this late period has been located. Whether the 992 AH figure derives from the 1966 first edition or from a revised edition (1984/1988) of Bayānī's *Aḥwāl va Āsār* has not been determined; multiple auction lot descriptions citing Bayānī reproduce the date.[^6] Huart's death date of 950 AH is demonstrably too early, since the corpus contains dated manuscripts from 956 and 957 AH.

[^5]: The 910 AH attribution is tentative: the colophon names the scribe as "Sultan Muhammad" without the laqab "Khandan." Bayānī (vol. I, pp. 268, 272) notes the scribe "may be" (احتمالاً) Khandan.

[^6]: A separate candidate, a calligraphic specimen (*qiṭʿa*) at the University of Michigan (Isl. Ms. 438, fol. 2a), has been attributed to Khandan by Saadati with a date of 914 AH, but the album contains 42 specimens by multiple calligraphers and the date assignment to this specific piece requires verification.

Fikri Saljūqī, writing in the *Majalla-yi Adabī-yi Herat*, records that Khandan's tombstone may survive at the Gāzurgāh shrine near Herat, in the vicinity of Khwāja ʿAbdullāh Anṣārī's mausoleum — a claim that has not been independently verified.

### 2.2 Colophon Signature Formulas

The corpus preserves over 20 distinct signature formulas (in Arabic script), which can be classified into five types:

**Type 1: Full name with laqab and preamble.** The most elaborate form, embedding the name within a humility formula (*al-ʿabd*, *mashqahu al-ʿabd*, *ʿalā yad*):

- على يد اضعف عباد الله الصمد المنان سلطان محمد الخندان (Arkeoloji 00153)
- مشقه العبد سلطان محمد خندان (Christie's *Subḥat al-Abrār*, 930 AH; Istanbul University qiṭʿa; Ḥazīna-yi Awqāf qiṭʿa)
- كتبه العبد سلطان محمد خندان غفر ذنبه (Sipahsalar qiṭʿa)
- العبد سلطان محمد خندان (Edinburgh qiṭʿa; Freer F1937.22)

**Type 2: Name with** *faqīr* **formula.** Emphasizing the scribe's humility:

- علی ید عبد الفقیر الحقیر سلطان محمد خندان (National Museum of Iran, Dīwān-i Navāʾī)
- الفقیر سلطان محمد خندان (Ḥazīna-yi Awqāf qiṭʿa variant)
- كتبه الفقير خندان في سنة ٩٢٣ (private Paris *Yūsuf va Zulaykha*, 923 AH)
- فقير خندان (Bodleian, *Dīwān-i Suhaylī*)

**Type 3: Name with *kataba* / *ḥarrara* (shorter forms).** Simpler formulas with the verb "wrote" or "composed" and the name, without the elaborate preambles of Type 1:

- كتبه سلطان محمد خندان (Bayānī collection)
- سلطان محمد خندان (Rylands *Dīwān-i Ḥāfiẓ*, 937 AH)
- عبده سلطان محمد خندان (Topkapi Revan qiṭʿa)
- كتبه محمد خندان (BL Delhi Persian 584A)

**Type 4: Name without laqab (ambiguous).** Where the colophon reads "Sultan Muhammad" without "Khandan":

- فقیر گنه‌کار سلطان محمد (Majlis *Dīwān-i Nasīmī*, 910 AH — tentative attribution)

**Type 5: Fragmentary or damaged.** Where physical damage prevents full reading:

- أضعف عبادالله [name lost to physical damage] (YEK 705856, *Bustān*)

The triangular colophon layout — in which the final lines of text taper to a point — was standard convention for nastaʿlīq manuscripts of this period, as illustrated by a contemporary example from the Walters Art Museum (Figure 1).

![Colophon of a Divan, Walters W.628](images/fig6_walters_w628_918_colophon.png)

*Figure 1. Colophon of a Dīwān (Walters Art Museum W.628, f. 156b, 918 AH / 1512 CE) by Zayn al-ʿĀbidīn al-Jāmī, illustrating the triangular layout convention of Safavid-era nastaʿlīq colophons. Walters Art Museum, CC0.*

The confirmed colophon from Arkeoloji 00153 (Type 1) represents the most elaborate formula, embedding the name within a standard Islamic humility preamble (*aḍʿaf ʿibād Allāh al-Ṣamad al-Mannān*). Its full text reads:

> قد وقع توفيق تنميق هذه الرسالة التي كانت الفاظها كبيره ومعانيها كثيره والمسمى بالهى نامه على يد اضعف عباد الله الصمد المنان سلطان محمد الخندان غفر ذنوبه وستر عيوبه

("There occurred the success of embellishing this treatise whose words were great and whose meanings were abundant, called *Ilāhīnāma*, at the hand of the weakest of the servants of God the Eternal, the Bountiful, Sulṭān Muḥammad al-Khandān — may [God] forgive his sins and conceal his faults.")

### 2.3 Disambiguation

Three categories of confusion complicate searches for Khandan manuscripts:

1. **Sultan Muhammad Nūr** (سلطان محمد نور). A distinct contemporary calligrapher, also a student of Sultan ʿAlī Mashhadī, active in the same Herat milieu. The two appear together in BL Or 11839 (a calligraphy album containing specimens by both) and in the Freer F1944.48 anthology (where different sections are attributed to different scribes). Careful attention to the laqab — نور vs. خندان — is essential.

2. **Khandānzāda** (خندان زاده). A later family name or *nisba* meaning "descendant of Khandān." The YEK portal's text tokenizer splits this compound, producing false matches for خندان. Three distinct Khandānzāda copyists were identified during search: Aḥmad b. al-Ḥājj Muḥammad al-Khandānzāda (1160 AH), Shaykh ʿAlī b. Ibrāhīm al-Arzinjānī al-Khandānzāda (1224 AH), and Qāḍī Aḥmad Efendī al-Khandānzāda (1169 AH) — all 18th-century figures, centuries after Khandan's activity.

3. **Adjectival** *khandān*. The Persian adjective خندان ("smiling," "laughing") is extremely common in poetry, often paired with گریان ("weeping"). Full-text searches of colophon fields return overwhelming numbers of false positives — verse quotations, not scribal signatures.

### 2.4 The 888 AH Anomaly

BL Or 8760, a *Dīwān-i Shāhī* (by Amīr Shāhī Sabzavārī, d. 857/1453), is catalogued with a date of 888 AH / 1482–83 CE and attributed to Khandan. This date precedes the calligrapher's earliest confirmed activity by 27 years. The most likely explanation is that 888 AH represents the date of text composition or of an earlier exemplar, not the date of this specific copy. Alternatively, the manuscript may have been copied by a different "Sultan Muhammad." Physical inspection of the colophon would resolve the ambiguity.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Overview

The corpus was assembled through a multi-source approach combining systematic portal searches, union catalog queries, online catalog scraping, and bibliographic analysis. No single source contained more than a fraction of Khandan's output; the final corpus of 48 entries required integrating information from Turkish, British, American, Iranian, and European sources, many using different cataloguing conventions, scripts, and languages.

### 3.2 YEK Portal (portal.yek.gov.tr)

The Yazma Eserler Kurumu Başkanlığı (YEK) is Turkey's national manuscript preservation authority, operating the largest online portal for Islamic manuscripts in Turkish collections. The portal provides an advanced search interface with field-specific queries, including *Nüshayla ilgili kişiler* (persons related to the manuscript), *İstinsah kaydı (Arap harfli)* (colophon text in Arabic script), *Mühürler* (seals), and *Genel Notlar* (general notes).

Four search sessions were conducted across two days (25–26 February 2026):

**Session 1** deployed three term tiers in the *Nüshayla ilgili kişiler* field: (1) full Arabic-script name سلطان محمد خندان, (2) abbreviated forms محمد خندان and خندان هروی, and (3) Latin transliterations ("Handan," "Khandan," "Sultan Muhammed Khandan"). Two genuine attributions were found: Arkeoloji 00153 (YEK 706550) and TIEM 01942 (YEK 704748).

**Session 2** expanded to the *İstinsah kaydı* field using colophon keyword fragments (كتبه خندان, حرره خندان) and tested title-based approaches for known Khandan texts (*Dīwān-i Bayqarā*, *Ilāhīnāma*). No new genuine attributions emerged, but four manuscripts of known Khandan texts were flagged for colophon verification.

**Session 3** tested remaining search permutations: خندان alone in *Genel Notlar*, various Latin orthographies ("Khondan," "Hendan"), and the suffix خندان زاده. Five new false positives were identified but no genuine attributions.

**Session 4** adopted a title-search strategy, querying for *Subḥat al-Abrār*, *Laylā va Majnūn*, *Yūsuf va Zulaykha*, and *Bustān* filtered by nastaʿlīq script (*Nesta'lîk* in YEK's terminology). Across 52 records examined, no new Khandan attributions were found, but one promising candidate (YEK 705856, a *Bustān* at Arkeoloji Recaizade Ekrem Bey 00066) was flagged for colophon verification.

The portal was judged exhaustively searched after all five term tiers had been applied across all relevant fields. Topkapi Palace Library records are included in the YEK system, though generally without digitized images.

### 3.3 FIHRIST

The FIHRIST union catalog of Islamic manuscripts in UK collections (fihrist.org.uk) maintains a person authority record for Khandan (person_f4139). Searching this record and related manuscript records on 26 February 2026 yielded six UK manuscripts linked to Khandan: five not previously in the corpus — BL Delhi Persian 584A (*Tazkirat al-awliyāʾ*, 920 AH), BL Or 8760 (*Dīwān-i Shāhī*, 888 AH), BL Or 11839 (calligraphy specimens album), Rylands Persian MS 842 (*Dīwān-i Ḥāfiẓ*, 937 AH), and Bodleian MS. Elliott 102 (*Dīwān-i Suhaylī*) — and one (BL Add. 7753, *Qirān al-Saʿdayn*, 921 AH) whose shelfmark was confirmed.

A critical finding emerged from the FIHRIST data: the "BL Ḥāfiẓ 921 AH" cited in multiple secondary sources (including baysunghur.org) does not correspond to any identifiable British Library manuscript. The confirmed Ḥāfiẓ dīwān by Khandan in a UK collection is the Rylands manuscript (937 AH, Herat), suggesting a bibliographic confusion of institution and date in the chain of citations from Bayānī.

### 3.4 Online Catalog Sweep

A systematic sweep of online catalogs was conducted on 26 February 2026, using both direct URL retrieval and keyword-based web searches. Sources included:

- **Museum databases:** Harvard Art Museums (accession 1985.263), Freer Gallery of Art (F1937.22, F1944.48), Cleveland Museum of Art (1983.1115.a), LACMA (1982.120.4), Gulbenkian Museum (LA159)
- **Auction archives:** Sotheby's (London 2018 lot 58; Paris 2015 lot 9), Christie's (lot 5125432; 2010 lot 174; Hoare collection 2019 lot 79), Bonhams (2005 lot 27), Roseberys (2020 lot 13; 2021 lot 101)
- **Published catalogs:** Chester Beatty Library Vol. II (1960), Karatay *Topkapi Farsça Yazmalar Kataloğu* (1961, cited but not directly consulted)
- **Secondary literature online:** baysunghur.org (Saadati 2021), Encyclopaedia Iranica, YJC.ir news reports

The baysunghur.org article proved the single most productive secondary source, cross-referencing approximately 29 items from Bayānī and other published sources. Six new codex entries and seven new *qiṭʿa* entries were added to the corpus from this source.

A further enrichment sweep on 27 February 2026, integrating findings from a curated research document on Khandan manuscripts, added four new entries (University of Michigan qiṭʿa, Berlin Humboldt Forum leaf, Majlis *Dīwān-i Nasīmī*, and a *Bustān* from the Oliver Hoare collection bearing a suspect pasted signature) and enriched several existing records.

### 3.5 Colophon Verification

For manuscripts with digitized images in the YEK system, colophon verification was attempted using high-resolution IIIF (International Image Interoperability Framework) images. The procedure was as follows:

1. Extract the internal IIIF identifier from the YEK viewer (by network interception or page-existence probing).
2. Navigate to the final pages of the manuscript (where colophons are typically located).
3. Acquire images at widths of 1,600 pixels or greater for text legibility.
4. Read the Arabic-script colophon, identifying the scribal signature formula and the presence or absence of the name "Khandan."

This process was applied to three YEK manuscripts: Arkeoloji 00153 (confirmed), TIEM 01942 (no colophon found), and YEK 705856 (inconclusive due to physical damage). Two additional manuscripts from Session 2 (TIEM 01992-002 and TIEM 02044-014) were examined but proved to be multi-text codices where the relevant text's colophon contained no scribal name.

### 3.6 Confidence Hierarchy

Each corpus entry is assigned one of five confidence levels:

| Level | Definition |
|-------|-----------|
| **Confirmed** | Colophon visually verified by this project; Khandan's name clearly legible. |
| **Attributed** | A signed colophon naming Khandan is documented in a primary published source (museum catalog, auction lot description) that the present authors judge credible, but the colophon has not been independently verified. |
| **Catalogued** | Listed in a scholarly catalog or bibliographic source with Khandan attribution, but no colophon text is available for verification. |
| **Unverified** | Secondary mention only; attribution rests on uncertain evidence (e.g., cataloguer entry without colophon, ambiguous colophon, physical damage). |
| **Bibliographic error** | Attribution resolved as mistaken. Retained in the corpus for documentation. |

---

## 4. Results: The Corpus

### 4.1 Overview

The corpus comprises 48 entries. Their distribution by confidence level is summarized in Table 1.

**Table 1: Corpus by Confidence Level**

| Confidence Level | Count | % |
|-----------------|------:|----:|
| Confirmed (colophon verified) | 1 | 2 |
| Attributed (signed colophon in primary source) | 12 | 25 |
| Catalogued (scholarly catalog, unverified) | 29 | 60 |
| Unverified (secondary mention only) | 5 | 10 |
| Bibliographic error (resolved) | 1 | 2 |
| **Total** | **48** | **100** |

The single confirmed entry (2%) reflects the limited availability of digitized manuscript images. The 12 attributed entries (25%) rest on the authority of museum and auction catalogs that describe signed colophons; these represent the most reliable portion of the corpus short of direct verification. The 29 catalogued entries (60%) — the largest group — derive primarily from Bayānī (1966) via the intermediary compilation of Saadati (2021). The five unverified entries include manuscripts with physical damage to the colophon, cataloguer-only attributions without colophon evidence, and one tentative attribution by Bayānī himself.

### 4.2 Textual Preferences

Khandan's corpus reveals strong preferences in his choice of texts. The *Bustān* of Saʿdī is the most frequently copied text, with six entries (including one candidate with a physically damaged colophon, one with a pasted, non-original signature, and one known only from a 1925 publication). Works by Jāmī dominate the codex manuscripts: *Yūsuf va Zulaykha* (3 copies), *Subḥat al-Abrār* (2 copies), *Laylī va Majnūn* (2 copies), and *Tuḥfat al-Aḥrār* (1 copy) — together accounting for eight entries from a single author's works, all from the *Haft Awrang* cycle. The *Dīwān-i Ḥāfiẓ* appears in three copies (Kabul, Rylands, and Chester Beatty), plus one resolved bibliographic error.

Beyond Persian literary classics, the corpus includes two copies of the *Dīwān-i Navāʾī* in Chagatay Turkish (reflecting the patron relationship with Navāʾī himself), one *Dīwān-i Sulṭān Ḥusayn Bayqarā* (also in Chagatay), a *Tazkirat al-awliyāʾ* of ʿAṭṭār (one of the longest texts at 382 folios), and the *Qirān al-Saʿdayn* of Amīr Khusraw Dihlavī (2 copies). There are also several devotional or religious works: an *Ilāhīnāma* attributed to Anṣārī Harawī, a *Munājātnāma* attributed to Imam ʿAlī, and a compilation of *Sayings of Imām ʿAlī*.

Approximately one-quarter of the corpus (12+ entries) consists of calligraphic specimens (*qiṭʿa*) preserved in *muraqqa'* albums. These range from single leaves in Western museum collections (Harvard 1985.263, Cleveland 1983.1115.a) to multiple specimens in the Ḥazīna-yi Awqāf albums at Topkapi (where at least four named albums contain Khandan qiṭʿa). Figures 2 and 3 illustrate two such specimens now in American collections.

### 4.3 Chronological Distribution

Of 48 entries, 23 bear dates (or approximate dates), while 25 are undated. Table 2 shows the distribution by decade.

**Table 2: Chronological Distribution by Decade**

| Decade (AH) | Approximate CE | Manuscripts |
|-------------|----------------|------------:|
| 880–889 | 1475–84 | 1 |
| 910–919 | 1504–14 | 4 |
| 920–929 | 1514–24 | 10 |
| 930–939 | 1524–34 | 4 |
| 940–949 | 1534–44 | 1 |
| 950–959 | 1544–54 | 2 |
| 970–979 | 1564–74 | 1 |
| Undated | — | 25 |
| **Total** | | **48** |

Three phases of activity emerge. The **early career** (910–919 AH) includes the tentatively attributed *Dīwān-i Nasīmī* (910 AH), a qiṭʿa possibly dated 914 AH, and the *Yūsuf va Zulaykha* (915 AH). The **peak period** (920–929 AH), which opens in the years surrounding Sultan ʿAlī Mashhadī's death in 926 AH, contains ten entries (including the resolved bibliographic error bl_hafiz_921) — a remarkable concentration suggesting intense scribal activity during the political upheavals surrounding the Safavid conquest of Herat (916 AH) and its aftermath. The **middle and late career** (930–972 AH) shows declining but continued output, with a notable gap between 957 and 972 AH (the Ḥazīna-yi Awqāf dated qiṭʿa and the Gulbenkian *Subḥat al-Abrār*, respectively).

The solitary entry in the 880s (BL Or 8760, 888 AH) is anomalous and almost certainly reflects a cataloguing convention where the text's composition date has been recorded as the manuscript date (see §2.4 above).

### 4.4 Geographic Distribution

The corpus is now dispersed across 11 countries and approximately 40 institutional and private holders (Table 3). Auction lots whose current locations are unknown are counted under the country of sale.

**Table 3: Geographic Distribution**

| Country | Institutions | Manuscripts |
|---------|------------:|------------:|
| United Kingdom | 12 | 15 |
| Iran | 9 | 10 |
| United States | 6 | 7 |
| Turkey | 6 | 7 |
| Russia | 2 | 2 |
| Ireland | 1 | 2 |
| France | 1 | 1 |
| Afghanistan | 1 | 1 |
| Portugal | 1 | 1 |
| Israel | 1 | 1 |
| Germany | 1 | 1 |

The United Kingdom holds the largest number (15 entries), reflecting both the historical depth of British Oriental collections and the active London auction market. Four manuscripts are at the British Library (catalogued under variant departmental names), with further holdings at the John Rylands Library, the Bodleian, and Edinburgh University Library; seven entries represent auction lots sold in London whose current locations are unknown. Iran's 10 entries span nine institutions, but none of these manuscripts have been independently verified online — they rest entirely on Bayānī and secondary sources. The seven American entries include major holdings at the Freer Gallery, Harvard, Cleveland, LACMA, and the University of Michigan, all with published catalog records. Turkey's seven entries include the only confirmed manuscript (Arkeoloji 00153) and the inconclusive candidate (YEK 705856), both in Istanbul.

The auction market accounts for a significant subset: at least seven codices have passed through Sotheby's, Christie's, Bonhams, or Roseberys since 2005, and their current locations are unknown. The Bonhams *Bustān* of 956 AH carries a remarkable provenance: Shah Abbas I → Shah Jahan → Shah Alam II, tracing the manuscript's journey from Safavid Iran to Mughal India.

### 4.5 Collaborative Manuscripts

Several corpus entries document the Herat workshop practice of collaborative manuscript production:

- **Freer F1944.48** (930 AH): An anthology in which four named scribes each copied a different section — Mīr ʿAlī Ḥusaynī (Rūmī), Sultan Muhammad Nūr (Niẓāmī), Muḥammad Qāsim b. Shādīshāh (Saʿdī), and Khandan (Sanāʾī's *Ḥadīqat al-ḥaqīqa*). Paintings are attributed to Bihzād.

![LACMA Horse and Groom verso](images/fig8_lacma_horse_groom_verso.jpg)

This folio has been proposed as part of the Bahram Mīrzā album (Topkapi H.2154), compiled by Dūst Muḥammad in 951/1544–45.

- **Gulbenkian LA159** (972 AH): The *Subḥat al-Abrār* was calligraphed by Khandan with paintings by ʿAbdullāh al-Shīrāzī, produced in Mashhad. As the latest dated manuscript in the corpus, it documents the continuation of collaborative production well into Khandan's late career.

- **Berlin Humboldt Forum leaf**: A composite *zarnavīsht* (gilded album leaf) with three calligraphers in a master–student chain: Muḥammad Ḥusayn Tabrīzī ("Mihīn Ustād"), Sultan ʿAlī Mashhadī, and Khandan. The leaf was identified in September 2024 at an exhibition in Berlin.

## 5. Case Studies in Verification

The five case studies below illustrate the range of outcomes when manuscript attributions are subjected to verification.

### 5.1 Arkeoloji 00153: The Gold Standard

The *Ilāhīnāma* at the Istanbul Archaeological Museums (YEK 706550) is a small manuscript of 10 folios in taʿlīq script. The colophon on folio 10a (digitized as page 11) was examined at multiple magnifications using IIIF images extracted from the YEK viewer (IIIF ID: 0000000665118). The name سلطان محمد الخندان is clearly legible in large nastaʿlīq at the base of a triangular colophon layout. The full colophon text was transcribed (see §2.2) and cross-checked against the YEK metadata transcription, which matched closely. Confidence: 0.95. The 0.05 deduction reflects minor damage to surrounding text, not the name itself.

This manuscript establishes the verification baseline: a complete, legible colophon with the full name including laqab, cross-confirmed by catalog metadata, in a digitized manuscript available through an institutional portal.

### 5.2 YEK 705856: The Torn Folio

![YEK 705856 opening page](images/fig5_yek_705856_opening_page.jpg)

*Figure 7. Opening pages of the Bustān, Arkeoloji Recaizade Ekrem Bey 00066 (YEK 705856), showing the illuminated ʿunwān and four-column nastaʿlīq layout consistent with an elite Herat workshop production. Istanbul Archaeological Museums. Source: YEK portal (IIIF).*

The *Bustān* at the Arkeoloji Müzeleri (Recaizade Ekrem Bey 00066, YEK 705856) represents the opposite extreme. The manuscript (144 leaves, 152 IIIF pages) was examined across three separate verification sessions. The colophon on IIIF page 147 left (folio 144v) contains the formula أضعف عبادالله — the same opening as the confirmed Arkeoloji 00153 colophon — but the right margin of the folio, where the scribe's name would appear in the right-to-left writing order, is physically torn and damaged.

Progressive magnification (up to 12× from the original IIIF image) confirmed that the damage is physical, not a digitization artifact: zone C crops show blank paper and a torn edge where text should continue (Figures 8–9). The YEK metadata preserves a fuller transcription (على يد أضعف عبادالله و أحوجهم إلی فضل الله), but this appears to be the cataloguer's reading — possibly from a period when the folio was less damaged, or from a secondary source.

![YEK 705856 full opening](images/fig3_yek_705856_full_opening.jpg)

*Figure 8. Final opening of the Bustān, Arkeoloji Recaizade Ekrem Bey 00066 (YEK 705856), f. 144v (left page). The colophon is visible in the lower-left corner, with physical damage to the right margin where the scribe's name would appear. Istanbul Archaeological Museums. Source: YEK portal (IIIF).*

![YEK 705856 colophon enhanced](images/fig4_yek_705856_colophon_enhanced.jpg)

*Figure 9. Enhanced detail of the colophon from Figure 8 (5× magnification, grayscale). The formula أضعف عبادالله ('the weakest of God's servants') is legible at left, but the right margin — where the scribe's name would continue in right-to-left writing order — is physically torn away.*

Verdict: inconclusive (confidence 0.45). The manuscript shows stylistic and formulaic consistency with Khandan's confirmed work, and it is held in the same collection, but the critical name portion is physically absent. No digital technique can recover text that no longer exists on the folio. The recommended next step is physical consultation with the Istanbul Archaeological Museums.

### 5.3 TIEM 01942: Cataloguer Attribution Without Colophon

The *Dīwān-i Sulṭān Ḥusayn Bayqarā* at the Türk ve İslam Eserleri Müzesi (TIEM 01942, YEK 704748) exemplifies the challenge of cataloguer-only attributions. The manuscript is beautifully illuminated with gold-flecked paper and *tezhīb* section headers, consistent with a high-quality Herat production. However, examination of the final pages (60–63 of 64) revealed that the text ends on page 61 with Chagatay Turkish poetry followed by a waqf seal and the museum shelfmark — no scribal subscription or signature of any kind.

The attribution to Khandan rests entirely on the YEK cataloguer's entry in the *Nüshayla ilgili kişiler* field. Without a colophon, the attribution cannot be confirmed or denied through the digitized images. This case illustrates a fundamental limitation: cataloguer attributions may reflect institutional knowledge, earlier scholarship, or stylistic judgment, but they lack the documentary certainty of a signed colophon.

### 5.4 "BL Ḥāfiẓ 921 AH": Tracing a Ghost Manuscript

Multiple secondary sources, including the baysunghur.org article, cite a *Dīwān-i Ḥāfiẓ* dated 921 AH at the British Library as a Khandan manuscript. Systematic searches of FIHRIST, the BL's own digitized manuscript catalog, and web searches for every plausible shelfmark returned no matching record. Meanwhile, FIHRIST clearly documents a Khandan *Dīwān-i Ḥāfiẓ* at the John Rylands Library, Manchester (Persian MS 842), dated 937 AH with a colophon naming Herat as the place of copying.

Saadati's article traces the citation to Bayānī, who places the manuscript at "the British Museum, London." Given that the John Rylands Library is in Manchester (not London), and that the dates differ (937 vs. 921), the most likely explanation is a compound error in the citation chain: confusion of institution (Rylands → "British Museum") and date (937 → 921). This entry was reclassified as a bibliographic error. The case demonstrates how citation errors can propagate through secondary literature, generating "ghost manuscripts" that do not correspond to any physical object.

### 5.5 Christie's Hoare *Bustān*: Pasted Signatures

The *Bustān* from the Oliver Hoare collection (Christie's, 25 October 2019, lot 79) is a 464-folio Safavid nastaʿlīq manuscript estimated at £3,000–5,000. Christie's own catalog description is notably cautious, describing Khandan's signature as **"pasted, purported"** — that is, physically glued onto the final folio rather than forming part of the original scribal colophon. The manuscript was re-sold at Mayfair Auction House in May 2023 (lot 31, estimated £16,500–17,500).

A pasted signature is a well-known phenomenon in the Islamic manuscript market: a calligrapher's name, cut from another document, is attached to an unsigned manuscript to enhance its commercial value. While the manuscript itself may be a genuine Safavid *Bustān*, the Khandan attribution cannot be accepted without physical examination to determine whether any original colophon exists beneath or alongside the pasted element. This entry is classified as "unverified."

## 6. Discussion

### 6.1 The 1-of-48 Problem

The most striking finding of this study is the radical asymmetry between the size of the corpus (48 entries) and the number of independently confirmed attributions (1). This is not primarily a methodological failure but a reflection of structural conditions: the vast majority of Khandan manuscripts are held in institutions that have not digitized their collections (or have not made digitized images freely accessible online). Of the UK manuscripts identified through FIHRIST, none have publicly accessible digital images. The same is true of all Iranian holdings, the Chester Beatty manuscripts, the Russian holdings, and most auction lots.

The 12 "attributed" entries — where museum or auction catalogs describe signed colophons — represent the most reliable stratum short of direct visual confirmation. These catalogs are prepared by specialist staff with access to the physical manuscripts, and their descriptions typically reflect professional judgment. Nevertheless, the gap between "described in a catalog" and "independently verified" remains significant, as the Hoare *Bustān* case illustrates.

### 6.2 Source Dependency on Bayānī

Approximately 30 of the 48 entries trace their attribution, directly or through intermediaries, to Bayānī's *Aḥwāl va Āsār* (1966). This creates a single point of dependence: if Bayānī's identifications contain errors, they will propagate silently through the corpus. The "BL Ḥāfiẓ 921 AH" case (§5.4) demonstrates this risk concretely.

Bayānī's work, moreover, is available only in Persian and only in print. No complete translation exists, and the volume cited here (vol. I, pp. 268–271) covers Khandan in just four pages. Scholars who do not read Persian must rely on intermediary citations, each step introducing potential for transcription error, date confusion, and shelfmark misattribution.

### 6.3 Digitization Gaps

The geographic distribution of the corpus highlights a paradox: the countries with the richest holdings (Iran, UK) are also those with the most limited online access to manuscript images.

- **Iran** (10 entries, 9 institutions): No publicly accessible digitized images. The Dirayati union catalog (noskhe.ir) is authenticated-access only and almost certainly contains additional Khandan entries invisible to this study.
- **United Kingdom** (12 entries across the British Library, Rylands, Bodleian, Edinburgh, and London auction houses): None of the British Library, Rylands, or Bodleian Khandan manuscripts have been digitized for public access. The Chester Beatty manuscripts (held in Dublin, Ireland) are likewise unavailable online.
- **Turkey** (7 entries, 6 institutions): The YEK portal provides the only digitized images in the corpus (Arkeoloji 00153, TIEM 01942, YEK 705856).
- **United States** (7 entries, 6 institutions): Museum catalog records are excellent, but full manuscript digitization is generally unavailable. The Michigan album (Isl. Ms. 438) is fully digitized on HathiTrust, but early scan quality limits legibility.

### 6.4 Future Priorities

The following actions would most significantly advance the corpus:

1. **Authenticated access to Dirayati** (noskhe.ir): Iran's national manuscript union catalog is the highest-priority unsearched source.
2. **Physical consultation of the Karatay (1961) catalog** for Topkapi entries 777 and 787, which are cited by multiple auction houses but have not been independently verified.
3. **Physical examination of YEK 705856** at the Istanbul Archaeological Museums to determine whether the damaged colophon preserves Khandan's name in a region not visible in digitized images.
4. **Contact with Russian institutions** (RNL, IOM RAS) to identify the Semenov *Bustān* and confirm the *Dīwān-i Navāʾī* shelfmark.
5. **Digitization requests** to the British Library, Rylands, and Bodleian for the six UK Khandan manuscripts at these institutions, which would immediately enable colophon verification.

---

## 7. Conclusion

This study presents the first consolidated and structured corpus of manuscripts attributed to Sultan Muhammad Khandan, assembling 48 entries from dispersed and heterogeneous sources into a single dataset. The corpus documents at least 57 years of calligraphic activity (915–972 AH / 1509–1564 CE) — potentially 62 years if the tentative 910 AH attribution is accepted — across 18 distinct texts (17 confirmed, one tentative), from major literary codices to single-leaf calligraphic specimens in royal albums.

The study confirms that Khandan's output was both prolific and geographically diffused: manuscripts and specimens are now held in 11 countries across some 39 institutional and private holders, with significant concentrations in the United Kingdom, Iran, the United States, and Turkey. His textual preferences center on Persian literary classics — the works of Saʿdī, Jāmī, and Ḥāfiẓ — though the corpus also includes Chagatay Turkish divans (reflecting the Navāʾī connection), religious texts, and a substantial body of calligraphic specimens preserved in *muraqqa'* albums from the Timurid, Safavid, and Mughal traditions.

The methodological contribution lies in demonstrating both the possibilities and the limits of digital catalog infrastructure for manuscript studies. The YEK portal enabled the only independent colophon verification in the corpus, proving the value of digitization for attribution scholarship. Simultaneously, the 1-of-48 confirmation rate exposes the vast digitization gap that persists for Islamic manuscripts — particularly in Iran and the United Kingdom, where the largest Khandan holdings reside. Until institutions undertake systematic digitization of their Persian manuscript collections, studies of individual calligraphers will remain fundamentally dependent on published bibliographic sources, with all the risks of error propagation that dependency entails.

The corpus dataset (`catalog/world_corpus.json`) is intended as a living document, to be updated as new manuscripts are identified, existing attributions are verified or corrected, and institutional digitization programs expand access. The signature formulas documented here, the chronological distribution, and the patterns of collaborative production all merit further analysis in the context of post-Timurid scribal practice and the social history of the Herat *kitābkhāna*.
